# This is a DEVELOPMENTAL repository for my version of Faithful 32x32 for Minecraft (Bedrock) BETAS
Due to the recent changes on Minecraft (Bedrock) betas, I am changing how updates to betas work. This repository will only be for the latest Minecraft BETA. For stable releases (not betas) of Minecraft, please use the links below. This repository is for Minecraft BETAS only.
